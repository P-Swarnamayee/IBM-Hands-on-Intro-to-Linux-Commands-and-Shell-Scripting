OVERVIEW OF LINUX ARCHITECTURE:
5 layers:
Layer - 1: User Interface (UI)
    * Allows users to interact with the machine
    * GUI
    Tasks: 
        - Using web browser to send an email      - Using a music player to listen to a song
Layer - 2: Applications
    * Any software that lets you perform a task
    * Applications include:
      - System tools    - Programming languages    - Shells    - User applications
Layer - 3: Operating System
    * Controls the jobs and programs vital to health and stability
    * Functions include:
      - Assigns software to users        
      - Helps detect errors and prevent failures
      - Performs file management tasks
Layer - 4: Kernal   
    * Perform vital opertions
    * Lowest level software
    * Starts on boot
    * Bridge between hardware and apps
    * Key jobs:
        - Memory management        - Process management
        -  Device drivers          - Security
Layer - 5: Hardware
    * Consists of all physical or electronic devices on your PC
    * Hardware includes:
        - CPU    - RAM    - Storage    - Screen    - USB devices

LINUX FILE SYSTEM
  * Collection of filees in your machine
  * Begins at root directory (/)
  * Tree like structure
  * Assigns appropriate access rights 

/ -> root directory
Some special directories:
/bin      /usr    /sbin    /etc    /dev    /proc    /var    /tmp
/home    /boot    /media    /lib    /opt    /mnt    /srv
