COMMUNICATING WITH LINUX SYSTEM:

USER ---> TERMINAL----> SHELL  OS  KERNEL --> HARDWARE
Explaination:
  First, we have a user who wants to run a command. 
  They enter the command in a terminal, which is then relayed to the shell. 
  The core components of the OS & kernel translate the command for the hardware to perform. 
  When the hardware completes the command, the kernel reads any changes or results and sends them back 
  via the shell to the terminal for the userâ€™s information. 
  The terminal is a powerful way to run applications and interact with your machine.
